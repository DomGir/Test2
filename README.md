#Description

I set up a Git repository, added a project board, and made the initial commit with the provided files. I created five GitHub issues for test cases, set up separate branches for each, and implemented the solutions. After creating pull requests, I merged the changes into the main branch and updated the project board accordingly. Finally, I updated the README.md with relevant project and personal details.
